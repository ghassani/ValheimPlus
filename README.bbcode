[b][size=6]ValheimPlus[/size][/b]
A HarmonyX Mod aimed at improving the gameplay quality of Valheim. The mod includes several different main features that allow users to modify the stats of players, buildings and entities. V+ also offers players the ability to build and place objects with very high precision through a sophisticated system, as well as tweaking and modifying already placed objects with equal precision. We also supply a high performance automation system for all production buildings to automatically pull and push from nearby chests, in addition of allowing to craft and build from nearby chests. The goal is to provide V+ as a base modification for Valheim to increase quality of life, tweak the game's difficulty, and in general, improve the player's experience. V+ also comes with a version and configuration control system for servers and users, enabling server owners to ensure that only players with the same configuration are able to join the server.

This guide does not cover how to create a dedicated server. 

These are the steps to install the mod:

1. Download the latest package called UnixServer.zip [url=https://github.com/valheimPlus/ValheimPlus/releases/latest/]over this link[/url]. (Scroll down and click "assets")
2. Extract the contents of the .zip file into your root server folder.
3. Make sure to run 'chmod u+x start_server_bepinex.sh' to make the start script executable.
4. Make sure that all uploaded files belong to the owner and group who owns and starts the Valheim server, e.g 'chown -R steam:steam ./valheim/
5. Configure server startup parameters:
[list]
    [*] If you intend to run the script directly, open it and edit the variables at the top (description included in the file).
    [*] If you want to define the parameters elsewhere, you can pass them to start_server_bepinex.sh as you would to the valheim server executable (description included in the file). This is recommended over the first approach, as updates will overwrite the start script and you would have to configure it again.
    [*] If you are using [url=https://linuxgsm.com]https://linuxgsm.com[/url], go inside your instance config file and change executable to "./start_server_bepinex.sh" to load the mod and your server arguments. More on LGSM config files can be found on [url=https://docs.linuxgsm.com/configuration/linuxgsm-config]their homepage[/url].
[/list]
6. Make sure to start the server via start_server_bepinex.sh, else the mod will not be loaded.

[list]
[*]Uses libc6-dev
[*]Most server hosters do not allow you to upload script files or make your own scripts executable (for very good reasons). You will have to wait until your hoster adapts V+ for his servers.
[*]Please read the section about Server Config & Version Control (About Version Enforcement) below.

[/spoiler]



[size=4][b][u]What if the game updates?[/u][/b][/size]
Game updates are unlikely to do more than partially break specific features of ValheimPlus at worst. 
In case you encounter any issues, use Steam's verify integrity feature and wait for it to download/update all files.
This should resolve any issues related. If you continue to have issues, contact the help channel in [url=http://discord.gg/valheimPlus]our discord server[/url].


[size=4][b][u]Configuration File[/u][/b][/size]
The Config file name is supposed to be "valheim_plus.cfg" and it needs to be placed in "BepInEx\config".

You can turn off and on every feature of V+ via the config file, by default all settings are turned off.

By default, the "BepInEx\config\valheim_plus.cfg" is created when you start your game or server the first time.

The configuration of a older version of Valheim Plus will automatically be updated to a newer version. [url=https://valheim-plus-config.web.app/]Alternatively you can use this website[/url].

When hosting a server, the server configuration file overwrites the client's configuration file on connect if you have the Server section and the serverSyncsConfig option enabled. 

Only the server configuration file (located in the server files) needs to be set up when hosting a server with V+ by default.

When hosting for other players over steam, every player will need v+ and they will receive the local settings from the host's game folder.
