  "A Valheim Game update was just released, what should I do?": {
    "answerweb": "A new Valheim game update is unlikely to do any more than partially breaking Valheim Plus, however sometimes things are changed in the base game which may complete stop the mod working. In case you encounter any issues, use Steam's verify integrity feature- wait for it to download/update all files and then simply unpack the valheim_Data folder from the downloaded package into your game folder again. This should resolve any issues related.",
